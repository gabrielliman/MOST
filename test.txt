Courage is not merely the absence of fear but the ability to act in spite of it. It is a composite of mental and moral fortitude. Courage lies in the center of enabling individuals to face daunting circumstances with resilience. This extends beyond the realm of physical dangers and covers the psychological and moral spheres. For instance, courage is manifest in a person who speaks up against injustice despite potential social repercussions. It’s also seen in individuals battling chronic illnesses, persisting through pain and uncertainty. This aspect of courage highlights its depth, transcending momentary acts to become a sustained state of being. In “To Kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee, Atticus Finch, the protagonist, exhibits profound moral courage. He defends a Black man, Tom Robinson, accused of a crime he didn’t commit, in a racially prejudiced town. This act of standing up for justice, despite societal backlash and personal risk, showcases Atticus’s deep-rooted courage. His courage lies not in a lack of fear, but in his commitment to what is right, even when it is unpopular and dangerous. Or if you are more of an Orwell fan, in his book “1984”, Winston Smith, the main character, displays psychological courage and strength in his quiet rebellion against the oppressive regime of Big Brother. His act of keeping a diary, falling in love, or even thinking against the Party’s doctrine, demonstrates a kind of internal courage. It’s a rebellion not just against the state but against the pervasive fear it instills, making Winston’s acts emblematic of courage in the face of psychological and ideological control.
